title: The Development of 2015 in Development
---

1. Less jQuery, more [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) packages.
2. Less grunt and gulp, more [npm scripts](http://artcommaco.de/post/116048060446/scripts-build-js-browserify).
3. Less underscore and lodash, more [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com) and pure JS.
4. Less Sublime Text, more Emacs, particularly with [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).
5. Less EJS and HTML, more Jade.
6. Less Node.js and JavaScript, more Clojure and ClojureScript.
7. Less MongoDB, more Postgres.
8. Less devops, more [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
9. Less note-taking apps, more Markdown.

Overall I'm moving towards simpler, more focused tools that I can combine to produce smaller, more easier to understand packages.
