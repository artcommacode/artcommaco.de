> Ryan Smith is an Australasian immigrant, living in Scotland and working for [Graphical House](http://www.graphicalhouse.co.uk) where he is a Senior Developer and technology wrangler for money. His interests are many and diverse (owing to his millennial attention span) and some of them include design, photography, hardcore punk and obscure fashion no-one has ever heard of.
> 
> His current foci are the functional programming languages&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;primarily Clojure, Haskell, and if he squints hard enough, Javascript&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and he spends his private development time arguing about them at length over the internet. You can read some of his opinions [here](http://artcommaco.de).
