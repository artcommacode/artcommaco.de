title: Merge
---

I put a lot of effort into avoiding mutation in my code and as such spend a heap of time typing `const new = Object.assign({}, original, {changed})`. In fact, in a recent project I wrote that 51 times.

However, it always felt like a bit of a hack having to supply the first argument as an empty object so it didn't mutate the original. I mentioned this to a friend and they showed me a tiny, neat function that relies on ES6's [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) syntax:

``` js
const merge = (...xs) => Object.assign({}, ...xs)
```

This meant I could now write `const new = merge(original, {changed})` instead, which seemed pretty neat until we thought about it a little and realised that all this time I could've just been writing `const new = {...original, changed}` insteadâ€¦

Thanks for reading part two of my ongoing series on overthinking problems!
