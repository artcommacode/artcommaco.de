title: A Type Driven Approach to Functional Design
---

Michael Feathers’ ([@mfeathers](https://twitter.com/mfeathers)) “[Type Driven Approach to Functional Design](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Type-Functional-Design)” is a perfectly-sized 20 minute talk on how to think about solving design problems in a functional way.

It also serves as a gentle introduction to Haskell's [Type Annotation](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses) which I personally find useful even when not working in Haskell, or in languages without proper typing at all! (JavaScript I'm looking at you)
