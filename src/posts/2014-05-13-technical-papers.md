title: Technical Papers

I have many dozens of technical papers saved to my hard drive but I thought I'd open up with some links to a selection of great papers I found from [Rasmus Anderson](http://rsms.me/)'s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rsms):

*   [A History of Haskell - Being Lazy With Class](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v95nri7awtieplf/A%20History%20of%20Haskell%20-%20Being%20Lazy%20With%20Class.pdf)
*   [Design of LISP-Based Processors (AIM-514)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4eeipdwgl4o1x08/Design%20of%20LISP-Based%20Processors%20%28AIM-514%29.pdf)
*   [Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7w11b2rznh2m9i7/Design%20Principles%20Behind%20Smalltalk.pdf)

*   [Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part 1 (John McCarthy, lisp, 1960)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2l9a1w51n2bvqe/Recursive%20Functions%20of%20Symbolic%20Expressions%20and%20Their%20Computation%20by%20Machine%2C%20Part%201%20%28John%20McCarthy%2C%20lisp%2C%201960%29.pdf)
*   [RRB-Trees - Efficient Immutable Vectors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o0iiofe1zo3j5ki/RRB-Trees%20-%20Efficient%20Immutable%20Vectors.pdf)
*   [Synthesis - An Efficient Implementation of Fundamental Operating System Services](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9lz3tdf94gvmttt/Synthesis%20-%20An%20Efficient%20Implementation%20of%20Fundamental%20Operating%20System%20Services.pdf)
*   [The GrAIL language and operations](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pi0g4sgk6r3ra8h/The%20GrAIL%20language%20and%20operations.pdf)
*   [The Implementation of Lua 5.0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vuxspyue6lca4jg/The%20Implementation%20of%20Lua%205.0.pdf)
*   [x86-64 Machine-Level Programming (CMU)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/94fvc5ink5a7rb7/x86-64%20Machine-Level%20Programming%20%28CMU%29.pdf)

Of these already great papers, [Joe Armstrong](http://joearms.github.io/)'s thesis “[Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1jdcr8g383gkn8/Making%20reliable%20distributed%20systems%20in%20the%20presence%20of%20software%20errors%20%28Erlang%2C%20Armstrong%29.pdf)” is my stand-out favourite. Written in a clear, concise manner it defines the problems he and his team were facing and goes on&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;through it's nearly 300 pages&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;to solve each of them. I could (and probably *should*) dedicate an entire post to this paper alone.
