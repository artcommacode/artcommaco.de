title: Developing a Static Site Generator
---

With the launch of the new site you may've noticed it's a lot quicker than it was before. I've moved the blog from Tumblr to my own static site generator, while I love that Tumblr comes with an in-built audience I wasn't really taking advantage of that and this move gives me the chance to put into place a lot of the practices that I've developed over the past few years since I first launched the blog.

Namely serving as few files as possible, as small as possible, as quickly as possible. I also wanted no JavaScript on the client, syntax highlighting, responsive images and minimal CSS.
